			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>My purpose is to start a photography business. I kind of do this project last semester, but I want to recreate a new one.

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>For the audience, I will focus on college students who want to take professional pictures or graduation photos and young couples who want to get married, so they need a photographer to help them shoot wedding photos.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>In this site, I will display a pop-up message when a user submits the contact form, toggle between different image categories in the gallery, and show different theme (light and dark) based on the time of day or switch by a interaction button.</p>
